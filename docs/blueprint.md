# **App Name**: Cartesian Cannon

## Core Features:

- Random Coordinate Generation: Generates random (x, y) coordinates within a defined range for students to plot.
- Interactive Cartesian Plane: Displays an interactive Cartesian plane where students can plot the generated points. Users should be able to clearly see if they were correct in their shooting attempts. Include hitboxes
- Cannon Shooting Interface: Implements a cannon shooting animation where the cannon fires a projectile towards the plotted point. Uses coordinate input fields that represent angle and velocity, which serve as hints for users to better their shooting.
- Score Tracking: Keeps track of the student's score based on the accuracy of their shots.
- Difficulty Levels: Offers different difficulty levels by adjusting the range of coordinate values and introducing quadrants.
- AI tutor: If the cannon misses, an AI tool will decide, using the position of impact, which variable (angle or velocity) the student needs to change and will offer suggestions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#87CEEB) to evoke a sense of open space and sky for the cannon theme.
- Background color: Light blue (#E0FFFF) - A desaturated shade of the primary, keeping it bright but not overwhelming.
- Accent color: Orange (#FFA500) to create contrast and draw attention to interactive elements, such as buttons and shooting trajectory.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use simple, clear icons for settings, scores, and different difficulty levels. Consistent style, resembling educational materials.
- Clean, intuitive layout with clear separation of the Cartesian plane, coordinate input fields, and score display.
- Smooth animations for the cannon firing, projectile movement, and point plotting to provide engaging feedback.
